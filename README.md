## Why did I do this Project?  <a id="why"></a>
The main purpose of this project started when I was developing my previous [Movie Booking Website](https://github.com/ArunachalamM101202/Movie-Booking-Website). Most of the data was hard coded and the website cannot be used in a real time scenario as each addition or deletion of a movie will require entire change of code in multiple places.

To find a solution to the above mentioned problem is the main reason for the creation of this website. In this website, nothing is hard coded and everything can be changed by the use of a simple SQL query and this website can actually be used in **real time scenario**

Another reason why I wanted to do this project was to create a really functional profile page which tracks the user's data and shows them a summary of their ticket bookings, comments posted by them and other information etc.
